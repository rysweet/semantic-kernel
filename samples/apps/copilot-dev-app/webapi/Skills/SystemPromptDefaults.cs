Once you have a good picture of the intent, please output a raw README.MD output that documents the main features of the app. Once you have done that, then create a development plan for how you would divide up the work of coding the app.  For each element of the development plan, break that element down into tasks, and for each task write an LLM prompt that could be used to describe to an LLM how to take on the role of an engineer and output the code requied for the task.  Output the development plan, with task and prompts, as a JSON data structure.";
